# Predictive_Analytics

Predictive analytics encompasses a variety of statistical techniques from data mining, predictive modelling, and machine learning, that analyze current and historical facts to make predictions about future or otherwise unknown events.

Key techniques in supervised machine learning are demostrated, such as classification using decision trees and nearest neighbour algorithms, and regression analysis. A particular emphasis is shown on evaluation of the performance of these algorithms.

Apart from these further topics are it also covered topics such as dimension reduction and cross validation and hyperparamter tuning for evalatuion.
